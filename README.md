# Advanced Digital Currency Simulation

Simulating the next generation digital financial systems for research and experimentation.

The project aims to create a **high-fidelity simulation platform for digital currency environments**,
designed to explore how different actors - users, merchants, and financial intermediaries - can interact together in a synthetic economy. While fully safe for public use, the platform allows for deep experimentation in financial modeling, transaction flows, and risk scoring. 

## Objectives
    
- Simulate complex interactions between participants across different industries, demographics, and account tiers. 
- Support thousands of simultaneous transactions, stress testing the simulation of economic behavior under extreme conditions. 
- Uses Python based backend with SQLite for prototyping (easily migratable to PostgreSQL or C++ later)

## Milestones To Hit 

Week 1: Create a **functional simulation using dummy variables of different people**, and simulate transactions, while handing out salaries in a tiered level every t seconds. 

Week 2: Incorporate AI models, to simulate different profiles for each person based on variables, like profession, transaction velocity, merchant diversity, and encourage spending if money remains idle for a while, or flag outlier transactions, and ask further clarifications. 

Week 3: Test the idea on Polygon Mumbai testnet, using a smart contract, and simulate transactions in real life 

Week 4/5: Create a polished UX/UI for our simulation and make deductions.
