# Next-Gen Digital Currency Simulation

An AI-Ready simulation of programmable digital currencies (CBDC) for the next generation digital financial systems for **research and experimentation**.

The project aims to create a **high-fidelity simulation platform for digital currency environments**,
designed to analyze customer and merchant behavior under tiered incentives and velocity-based spending models.


(Contributions, feedback, and ideas are greatly appreciated, especially for AI modeling, and designing architecture)

## Motivation

- Current financial systems can't prototype with programmable money due to high risk of blowback. 
- Existing CBDC simulations are too slow, centralized, and lack observations of potential future pipelines built on digital currencies. 
- Traditional payment processing platforms are underestimating the true power behind CBDC, giving anyone an immense edge working in this area.
- Incentives like automatic cashback on consumption can stimulate spending before macroeconomic tools are even applied.

## Objectives
    
- Simulate complex interactions between participants across different industries, demographics, and account tiers. 
- Support **thousands of simultaneous transactions**, stress testing the simulation of economic behavior under high-frequency and high-volume conditions. 
- Use Python based backend with PostgreSQL; SQLite used only for early experimentation
- Examine how CBDCs can considerably be more efficient than current traditional systems
- Learn **a lot**, and iterate **fast**

## Milestones To Hit 

Week 1: Create a **functional simulation**.

Week 2: Incorporate local AI models with cloud learning, to simulate different profiles for each person based on variables, like profession, transaction velocity, merchant diversity, and encourage spending if money remains idle for a while, or flag outlier transactions, and ask further clarifications. 

Week 3/4: Create a polished UX/UI for our simulation and add further features
